# Backend

This submodule is dedicated to the shop functionality of the Muimbaji eShop web application. It is built using Strapi CMS and facilitates the management of products, enabling operations such as adding, editing, and deleting products. The backend utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store data and is seamlessly connected to the Cloudinary service for media storage and optimization.
